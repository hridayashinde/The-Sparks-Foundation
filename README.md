Code for tasks allowed by The Sparks Foundation for GRIP Jan'21


Task 1
Prediction using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner)
● Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.
● Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data
● What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

Task 2
Prediction using Unsupervised ML (Level - Beginner)
● From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
● Use R or Python or perform this task
● Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

Task 6
Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm
(Level - Intermediate)
● Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
● The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
● Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox
